__PROJECT DESCRIPTION__:

This project focuses on developing an AI-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The chatbot is designed as a web-based application that can interact with users and answer their queries in a conversational manner.

The system uses Python as the backend programming language and Flask as the web framework.
For understanding user input and generating relevant responses, NLP libraries such as NLTK are used.
The chatbot processes user queries using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find the most appropriate response from the knowledge base.

The frontend of the chatbot is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple and user-friendly interface similar to real-world chat applications.
Users can type questions through the website, and the chatbot responds instantly based on text similarity.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Artificial Intelligence and NLP concepts in real-time conversational systems and can be extended further with advanced features such as voice input, multilingual support, or database integration.

__🎯 OBJECTIVES__:

- To understand the basics of Artificial Intelligence and NLP.

- To build a web-based chatbot application.

- To process and analyze user queries using NLP techniques.

- To provide automated responses to user questions.

- To gain hands-on experience with Flask and Python.

__🧠 TECHNOLOGIES USED__:

- Programming Language: Python.

- Web Framework: Flask.

- NLP Library: NLTK.

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

- Algorithm: TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity.

__⚙️ WORKING OF THE SYSTEM (Short)__:

- User enters a query through the website.

- The query is sent to the Flask backend.

- NLP preprocessing is applied (tokenization, lemmatization).

- TF-IDF and cosine similarity are used to match the query.

- The best-matched response is returned to the user.

__✅ ADVANTAGES__:

- Easy to use.

- Fast response time.

- Reduces human effort.

- Can be accessed through a web browser.

- Extendable for future enhancements.

__🌍 APPLICATIONS__:

- Customer support systems.

- Educational assistance.

- College information systems.

- FAQ bots.

- Online help desks.

__🏁 CONCLUSION__:

The AI Chatbot using NLP successfully demonstrates how machines can understand and respond to human language.
This project provides a strong foundation for building intelligent conversational systems and helps learners gain practical exposure to AI, NLP, and web development.
